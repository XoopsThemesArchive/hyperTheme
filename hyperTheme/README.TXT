[b]Installation:[/b]

This theme is packed to install into the xoops root directory which would map to your public_html or www folder.
You need to make sure the /class and /themes directories get copied into the root dir of your xoops site.
If you do not wish to use the Smarty Randomizer plugin, then simply copy the /themes directory into your 
xoops themes directory and modify the block thml template files to not use the Smarty Plugin.
If this would be the case, I would recommend using the Smarty <{Cycle}> tags or choosing ONE colored gem pill
and editing the block theme files for this.
If you have question about doing this, contact me on www.webs1te.com

I would recommend to move or not upload the /art directory as this contains a 432kb PSD file for the logo template.

[b]Bugs:[/b]

There are a few tiny tweaks that can be made. I noticed a few pixels off in certain cases. I welcome any fixes for this.
There seems to be a bug only in IE that doesn't seem to load the theme properly on some page loads.
The horizaontal block headers go out way to far, any input to fix this is welcome!
This theme appears to work great in FireFox... go figure.

[b]Notes:[/b]

This theme doesnt leave a whole lot of room for block titles. (like most themes)
If you need more room becasue your block titles are too long and you cannot shorten them,
I suggest editing the CSS and making the block title fonts smaller in size.


Hope you can enjoy, any suggestions for fixes and improvements are welcome.
Please fill out the contact page on www.webs1te.com for this.
